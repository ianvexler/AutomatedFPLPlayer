    abstract = {Imagine you are managing a football team and have a fixed budget for
    salaries. Which players should you draft for your team? We investigated this
    question using the wealth of data available from fantasy premier league
    football (soccer). Using the players' data from past seasons, for several
    seasons and several different budget constraints, we identified the highest
    scoring fantasy team for each season subject to each budget constraint. We then
    investigated quantifiable characteristics of these teams. Interestingly, across
    nearly every variable that is significant to the game of football and the
    budget, these top teams display diversity across these variables. Our results
    indicate that diversity is a general feature of top performing teams.},

    abstract = {In fantasy sports, the goal is to gain as many points as possible. To get there, users have to choose players with the optimal price-to-performance ratio. However, finding these optimal players requires a great amount of time and effort, in which the users might not be willing to invest. Instead, they can use heuristic strategies. This paper investigates one such strategy for choosing squads based on the assumption that athletes starting for the favourite team of the match would bring users more points—in line with the representativeness heuristic. The data come from the Czech fantasy league according to the Premier League in the season 2015–16. The econometric model examines the percentage of squads a player was chosen into. The Ordinary Least Squares method used here uses control variables indicating performance, price, Czech nationality, and the game position of the athletes. The results show that users choose their squads primarily based on players’ past performances, but also take the favourite team into account. By applying the latter heuristic users aim to simplify the process decision-making but they overestimate the impact of belonging to a favourite team.},

@article{GuptaAkhil2019TSMf,
    abstract = {The performance of football players in English Premier League varies largely
    from season to season and for different teams. It is evident that a method
    capable of forecasting and analyzing the future of these players on-field
    antics shall assist the management to a great extent. In a simulated
    environment like the Fantasy Premier League, enthusiasts from all over the
    world participate and manage the players catalogue for the entire season. Due
    to the dynamic nature of points system, there is no known approach for the
    formulation of a dream team. This study aims to tackle this problem by using a
    hybrid of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Recurrent Neural
    Networks (RNNs) for time series prediction of player points and subsequent
    maximization of total points using Linear Programming (LPP). Given the player
    points for the past three seasons, the predictions have been made for the
    current season by modeling differently for ARIMA and RNN, and then creating an
    ensemble of the same. Prior to that, proper data preprocessing techniques were
    deployed to enhance the efficacy of the prepared model. Constraints on the type
    of players like goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and forwards along with the
    total budget were effectively optimized using LPP approach. The validation of
    the proposed team was done with the performance in upcoming season, where the
    players outperform as expected, and helped in strengthening the feasibility of
    the solution. Likewise, the proposed approach can be extended to English
    Premier League by official managers on-field.},

@article{BonelloNicholas2019MDAf,
    abstract = {27th AIAI Irish Conference on Artificial Intelligence and
    Cognitive Science. 2019 Fantasy Premier League (FPL) performance predictors tend to base their
    algorithms purely on historical statistical data. The main problems with this
    approach is that external factors such as injuries, managerial decisions and
    other tournament match statistics can never be factored into the final
    predictions. In this paper, we present a new method for predicting future
    player performances by automatically incorporating human feedback into our
    model. Through statistical data analysis such as previous performances,
    upcoming fixture difficulty ratings, betting market analysis, opinions of the
    general-public and experts alike via social media and web articles, we can
    improve our understanding of who is likely to perform well in upcoming matches.
    When tested on the English Premier League 2018/19 season, the model
    outperformed regular statistical predictors by over 300 points, an average of
    11 points per week, ranking within the top 0.5% of players rank 30,000 out of
    over 6.5 million players.},

    abstract = {The chapter describes a neural network architecture that can represent any input-output mapping function. The back-propagation algorithm calculates the error and propagates local gradients to set the weights and biases of the neural network. The network is constrained to have the ideal complexity, as high model complexity can lead to high variance and overfitting, while low model complexity can lead to a high bias and underfitting. The recurrent neural network has cycles and can thus take a sequence of input to produce a sequence of output. Deep learning architectures use several layers. The convolution neural network uses learnable convolution operators in a layered manner. The long-short term memory network applies a recurrent model while frequently forgetting to amplify the retention of the long-term sequence information. The fuzzy inference system is also modelled as a neural network to learn from a back-propagation algorithm called adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system.}
